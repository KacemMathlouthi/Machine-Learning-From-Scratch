# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python.

## Contents

- `.gitignore`
- `README.md` - Project description
- `requirements.txt` - Required Python packages

### Algorithm Implementations

- Decision Tree
- K-Means Clustering  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Perceptron
- Random Forest

Each algorithm folder contains:
- Python implementation file (e.g. `DecisionTree.py`)
- Jupyter notebook for training/testing (e.g. `train.ipynb`)

## Usage

The algorithms are implemented as Python classes that can be imported and used. The Jupyter notebooks demonstrate how to use each algorithm on sample datasets.

## Key Features

- Implemented core ML algorithms from scratch
- Clean, documented code
- Jupyter notebooks to visualize and test algorithms
- Minimal dependencies (mainly numpy, sklearn for datasets)

This project provides educational implementations to understand the inner workings of fundamental machine learning algorithms.
